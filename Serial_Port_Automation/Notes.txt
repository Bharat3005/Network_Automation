Simulating a Serial Connection with Linux and GNS3

In order to test the pyserial module and automate the configuration of networking devices over serial connections, you need a physical device to connect to.

However, there is a way to simulate a serial console in GNS3 and connect to it from a Linux machine (tested with Ubuntu, GNS3 is installed and runs on Ubuntu).


1. Install the following packages on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install screen

    sudo apt install socat


2. Start the device in GNS3 and find out the port to which the telnet console is mapped

On Ubuntu execute: ps -ef | grep telnet

In this example, the port is 5008.


3. In a terminal, execute the next command to map the telnet port to a virtual serial port:

socat pty,link=/home/YOUR_USER/ttyS0,raw,echo=1 tcp:localhost:5008


4. In another terminal, execute the next command to initiate a session:

screen /home/YOUR_USER/ttyS0 9600


After, we press ENTER and close the terminal when the device prompt has appeared.


In the first terminal, we press Ctrl+c to cancel the socat command, and we execute the same one more time.

socat pty,link=/home/YOUR_USER/ttyS0,raw,echo=1 tcp:localhost:5008


Now, we can use the pyserial module in our Python programs:
